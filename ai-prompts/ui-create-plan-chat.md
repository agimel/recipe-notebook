GitHub Copilot: I'll follow the instructions in the prompt file to create a UI architecture document. Let me first gather the required files.

Now I have all the necessary context. Let me create the UI architecture document by synthesizing the information from the PRD, API plan, and UI planning summary. 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/aage/My%20Private%20Documents/recipe-notebook/ai/ui-plan.md)

UI architecture document created successfully. The document synthesizes information from the PRD, API roadmap, and UI planning summary to provide a comprehensive architecture covering:

1. **UI Framework Overview** - React SPA with Material-UI, mobile-first approach
2. **List of Views** (6 main views) - Login, Registration, Recipe List, Recipe Detail, Create, and Edit views with detailed specifications
3. **User Journey Map** - 6 key user journeys from registration through CRUD operations
4. **Navigation Layout** - Desktop and mobile navigation patterns with global elements
5. **Key Components** - 30+ reusable components organized by category
6. Additional sections covering data flow, responsive design, accessibility, security, performance, error handling, testing, and implementation roadmap

The document focuses exclusively on architecture, structure, and organization as requested, without visual design details or implementation code.

Made changes.
